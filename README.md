# HTTP Server with NodeJS

This is a simple HTTP Server example with NodeJS. To start that just execute the command below:

```
node index.js
```

In case you have doubt why I'm not using semicolon is because I get inspiration from this talk: [Semicolons cannot save you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlr-FGbhKaI).
